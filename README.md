These files are notes dedicated to documenting my learning experience in the game dev community.
Its full of handy tutorials and pointers on stuff that I personally found confusing
They are written in obsidian, so you have to have obsidian installed and import these MD files over to obsidian in order for you to effectivley read and access these notes
Also, all the important notes and main information are listed in the GAME DEV page, which acts as a table of contents kinda.
Please let me know if you have any issues, and I will read and consider any and all pull requests.
