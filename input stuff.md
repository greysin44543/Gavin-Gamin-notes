# GetMouseButtonDown vs Getmousebutton

GetMouseButtonDown checks for a single press, and # GetMouseButton checks if your holding it or not. logic works the same with GetKeyDown. also for GetMouseButtonDown theres a parameter, which is either 0 or 1, if you wanna check for input from the left click, type 0, and the right is 1.
